# odin-tictactoe
First time implementing factory functions and modules (not like import/export modules, the other one). The goal is to have as little pollution in the global namespace as possible.

My site now meets all the requirements for the project. 
Things I would like to implement:
1. Nicer UI
2. Mobile compatability
3. Computer option
